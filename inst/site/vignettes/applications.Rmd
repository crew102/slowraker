This vignette presents three examples of using `slowrake()` to find keywords in text. Each application runs RAKE on a different type of document, including a webpage, patent abstract(s), and a journal article. 

## Webpage

#### 1. Download the HTML and run RAKE

```{r}
# Load the libraries needed for all three applications
library(slowraker)
library(httr)
library(xml2)
library(patentsview)
library(dplyr)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)

# The webpage of interest - slowraker's "Getting started" page
url <- "https://crew102.github.io/slowraker/articles/getting-started.html"

GET(url = url) %>% # Download the source
  content("text") %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  xml_find_all(".//p") %>% # Extract text from paragraph nodes
  xml_text() %>% 
  paste(collapse = " ") %>% # Paste paragraphs together
  iconv(from = "UTF-8", "ASCII", sub = '"') %>% 
  slowrake() %>% # Run RAKE
  .[[1]]
```

## Patent abstracts  

#### 1. Download patent data

```{r}
# Download data for patents that are related to "keyword extraction" from the PatentsView API.
pv_data <- search_pv(
  query = qry_funs$text_phrase(patent_abstract = "keyword extraction"),
  fields = c("patent_number", "patent_title", "patent_abstract"),
  all_pages = TRUE
)

# Look at the data
patents <- pv_data$data$patents
kable(head(patents, n = 2))
```

#### 2. Run RAKE on the abstracts

```{r, results = "hide"}
rakelist <- slowrake(
  patents$patent_abstract,
  stop_words = c("method", smart_words), # Consider "method" to be a stop word
  stop_pos = pos_tags$tag[!grepl("^N", pos_tags$tag)] # Only use words that are nouns
)

# Create a single data frame with all patents' keywords
out_rake <- rbind_rakelist(rakelist, doc_id = patents$patent_number)
head(out_rake)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(out_rake)
```

#### 3. Show each patent's top keyword

```{r}
out_rake %>% 
  group_by(doc_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(score)) %>%
  slice(1) %>% 
  inner_join(patents, by = c("doc_id" = "patent_number")) %>% 
  rename(patent_number = doc_id, top_keyword = keyword) %>% 
  select(matches("number|title|keyword")) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

## Journal article

#### 1. Get PDF text

```{r, results = "hide"}
# The journal article of interest - Rose et. al (i.e., the RAKE publication)
url <- "http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/22/04707498/0470749822.pdf"

# Download file and pull out text layer from PDF
destfile <- tempfile()
GET(url, write_disk(destfile))
raw_txt <- pdf_text(destfile)
```

#### 2. Apply basic text cleaning 

```{r}
# Helper function
sub_all <- function(regex_vec, txt) {
  pattern <- paste0(regex_vec, collapse = "|")
  gsub(pattern, " ", txt)
}

txt1 <- 
  paste0(raw_txt, collapse = " ") %>% 
    gsub("\\r\\n", " ", .) %>% 
    gsub("[[:space:]]{2,}", " ", .)

# Regex to capture text that we don't want to run RAKE on
remove1 <- "Acknowledgements.*"
remove2 <- "TEXT MINING"
remove3 <- "AUTOMATIC KEYWORD EXTRACTION"

txt2 <- sub_all(c(remove1, remove2, remove3), txt1)
```

#### 3. Detect and remove non-paragraphs

There are some sections of the PDF's text that we don't want to run RAKE on, such as the text found in tables. The problem with tables is that the text inside them usually doesn't contain typical phrase delimiters (e.g., periods and commas). Instead, the cell of the table acts as a sort of delimiter. However, it's difficult to determine which parts of the PDF correspond to tables, let alone parse the cells out.[^1] We would therefore like to determine which sections of the text are likely to be tables, so that these sections can be removed. 

Most of the tables in this article have numbers in them. If we split the PDF into text chunks using a digit delimiter, it's likely that most of a table's text will end up in a relatively small-sized chunk. We can then filter out these small chunks, leaving us with the paragraphs. 

```{r}
# Numbers generally appear in paragraphs in two forms in this article: 1) When the authors refer to results in a specific table/figure (e.g., "the sample abstract shown in Figure 1.1"), and 2) When the authors reference another article (e.g., "Andrade and Valencia (1998) base their approach"). Remove these instances so that paragraphs don't get split apart.
remove4 <- "(Table|Figure) [[:digit:].]{1,}"
remove5 <- "\\([12][[:digit:]]{3}\\)"
txt3 <- sub_all(c(remove4, remove5), txt2)

# Split text into chunks based on digit delimiter
txt_chunks <- unlist(strsplit(txt3, "[[:digit:]]"))

# Count alpha chars in each chunk
num_alpha <- str_count(txt_chunks, "[[:alpha:]]")

# Use kmeans to determine what a paragraph's minimum char count should be
clust <- kmeans(num_alpha, centers = 2)
good_clust <- which(max(clust$centers) == clust$centers)

# Only keep chunks that are thought to be paragraphs
good_chunks <- txt_chunks[clust$cluster == good_clust]
final_txt <- paste(good_chunks, collapse = " ")
```

#### 4. Run RAKE

```{r}
rakelist <- slowrake(final_txt)

kable(head(rakelist[[1]]))
```

#### 5. Filter out bad keywords

The fact that some of the keywords shown above are very long suggests we missed something in Step 4. It turns out that our method mistook one of the tables for a paragraph (Table 1.1 shown below). Table 1.1 is somewhat atypical in that it doesn't contain any numbers, and thus it makes sense that our method missed it. 

![](table-1-1.png)

To clean up the results, let's apply an ad hoc filter on the keywords. This filter removes keywords whose long length indicates that a phrase run-on has occurred, and hence the keyword is no good.

```{r}
# Function to remove keywords that occur only once and have more than max_word_cnt constituent words
filter.rakelist <- function(x, max_word_cnt = 3) {
  structure(
    lapply(x, function(r) {
      word_cnt <- str_count(r$keyword, " ") + 1
      to_filter <- r$freq == 1 & word_cnt > max_word_cnt
      r[!to_filter, ]
    }),
    class = c("rakelist", "list")
  )
}

filter <- function(x) UseMethod("filter")

filter(rakelist)[[1]]
```

[^1]: There are better solutions to identifying tables in PDFs than the one I use here (e.g., the [tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/) Java library and its corresponding R wrapper, [tabulizer](https://github.com/ropensci/tabulizer#installation)).
