\usage{
slowrake(txt, stop_words = smart_words, stop_pos = c("VB", "VBD", "VBG",
  "VBN", "VBP", "VBZ"), word_min_char = 3, stem = TRUE,
  phrase_delims = "[[:space:]]-[[:space:]]|[,.?():;\\"!/]")
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{A character vector, where each element of the vector contains the
text for one document.}

\item{stop_words}{A vector of stop words which will be removed from your
documents. The default value (\code{smart_words}) contains the 'SMART' stop
words (equivalent to
\href{https://rdrr.io/rforge/tm/man/stopwords.html}{tm::stopwords('SMART')})
. Set \code{stop_words = NULL} if you don't want to remove stop words.}

\item{stop_pos}{All words that have a part-of-speech (POS) that appears in
\code{stop_pos} will be considered a stop word. \code{stop_pos} should be a
vector of POS tags. All possible POS tags along with their definitions are
in the \code{\link{pos_tags}} data frame (\code{View(slowraker::pos_tags)}).
The default value is to remove all words that have a verb-based
POS (i.e., \code{stop_pos = c("VB", "VBD", "VBG", "VBN", "VBP", "VBZ")}).
Set \code{stop_pos = NULL} if you don't want a word's POS to matter during
keyword extraction.}

\item{word_min_char}{The minimum number of characters that a word must have
to remain in the corpus. Words with fewer than \code{word_min_char}
characters will be removed before the RAKE algorithm is applied. Note
that removing words based on \code{word_min_char} happens before stemming,
so you should consider the full length of the word and not the length of
its stem when choosing \code{word_min_char}.}

\item{stem}{Do you want to stem the words before running RAKE?}

\item{phrase_delims}{A regular expression containing the patterns that
will be used as phrase delimiters.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{rakelist}, which is just a list of data
  frames (one data frame for each element of \code{txt}). Each data frame
  will have the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{keyword}{A keyword that was identified by RAKE.}
    \item{freq}{The number of times the keyword appears in the document.}
    \item{score}{The keyword's score, as per the RAKE algorithm. Keywords
    with higher scores are considered to be higher quality than those with
    lower scores.}
    \item{stem}{If you specified \code{stem = TRUE}, you will get the
    stemmed versions of the keywords in this column. When you choose stemming,
    the keyword's score (\code{score}) will be based off its stem,
    but the reported number of times that the keyword appears (\code{freq})
    will still be based off of the raw, unstemmed version of the keyword.}
  }
}
\description{
A relatively slow version of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm. See \href{http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/22/04707498/0470749822.pdf}{Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents} for
details on how RAKE works or read the "Getting started" vignette (
\code{vignette("getting-started")}).
